* What Is a Python Traceback?
A traceback is a report containing the function calls made in the code at a specific point. 
Tracebacks can be called stack trace, stack traceback, backtrace, and others. In Python, the term used is traceback. 
When the program results in an exception, Python will print the current traceback to help debugging.
